End-to-End Multi-class Text Classification to predict user's TV-rating

1. Compared Feature-based approach vs Deep Learning approach

2. End-to-End
   - Data gathering : Webscraping from dynamic webpages using "Selenium"
   - Sub-sampling by proper sampling strategy
   - Cleaning raw text 
   - Feature extraction and engineering from texts
   - Modeling : GBM, SVM and Bidirectional LSTM
   - Hyper-parameters tuning by Bayesian Optimization
   - Stacking models
 
3. Implemented in a reproducible way

Details are in the PDF file.
